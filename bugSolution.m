To fix this, always remove observers in the observer's `dealloc` method or whenever the observation is no longer needed.  

```objectivec
@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Handle KVO changes...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [self.observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// Or, remove the observer earlier if observation is no longer needed:

[observedObject removeObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
```

**Important Considerations:**

* Use `removeObserver:` with the same key path and context used in `addObserver:`. 
*  Consider using weak references where appropriate in your observer to avoid potential retain cycles.  This is important for preventing memory leaks.  However, directly using a weak reference to the observed object inside of `observeValueForKeyPath` will result in unexpected behavior.
*  Employ proper memory management practices throughout your application to prevent related memory issues.
