# Objective-C KVO Crash: Observer Not Removed Before Deallocation

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Failure to remove KVO observers before the observed object is deallocated can lead to crashes.  The example code showcases the problem and provides a solution.

## Problem

When an object observes another object using KVO, it creates a strong reference to the observed object (implicitly or explicitly). If the observer isn't removed before the observed object is deallocated, the observer will still hold a reference to the deallocated object, leading to an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error when the observer attempts to access the object's properties.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that KVO observers are removed using `removeObserver:` in the appropriate lifecycle methods (like `dealloc` or when the observation is no longer needed) of the observer or any other suitable location before observed object gets deallocated. This breaks the strong reference, preventing the crash.
